Installation
============
1. Follow Moodle's instructions for installing plugins, see: Installing Moodle links.
2. Turn editing mode on.
3. Go to Site administration -> Plugins -> Blocks -> Theme selector and decide if you want URL switching or not.
   When URL Switching is off only users with the 'moodle/site:config' capability will be able to change themes.
   Theme changes are permenant for all.
   When URL Switching is on everybody can change the theme but it will only be for them.  The set site theme will
   remain as set by a user with 'moodle/site:config' capability.
4. Add the "Theme selector" block wherever you like.
5. The selector will show the current theme as the one selected.
